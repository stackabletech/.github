# Stackable Support

This article explains how to get help with Stackable products

## Community Support

We have multiple ways you can interact with us.
All of these paths come without an explicit SLA.
We try to answer all questions but sometimes we might not have the bandwidth to do so or it'll slip through the cracks.

* You can open a discussion in our [GitHub discussions forum](https://github.com/orgs/stackabletech/discussions)
* You chat with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/7kZ3BNnCAF)
* If you found a bug you can open an issue in GitHub

## Business Support

We love open-source!
But we also like to get paid for our work, which is why we do offer professional support with an SLA.
You can find details on our [homepage](https://stackable.tech/en/plans/#subscription).

## Sponsorship

If you do not need our help but still want to show your appreciation for our work we'll take your [sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/stackabletech) as well.
