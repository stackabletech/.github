# Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to a work, of Stackable GmbH (“Stackable”).
To clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity (“Contributor”), Stackable must have a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below.
This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of Stackable;
it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

By electronically signing, you are consenting to transact electronically and are entering into a binding contract, and you accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for your Contributions submitted to Stackable.

BEFORE SIGNING AND/OR CLICKING A BUTTON TO ACCEPT, CAREFULLY READ THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.

## 1. Definitions

### You

"You" (or "Your" or "your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with Stackable.
For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor.
For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

### Contribution

"Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to Stackable for inclusion  in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by Stackable (the "Work").
For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Stackable or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Stackable for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

## 2. Your Employer
References to “employer” in this Agreement include Your employer or anyone else for whom You are acting in making Your Contribution, e.g., as a contractor, vendor, or agent.
If Your Contribution is made in the course of Your work for an employer or Your employer has intellectual property rights in Your Contribution by contract or applicable law, You must secure permission from Your employer to make the Contribution before signing this Agreement.
In that case, the term “You” in this Agreement will refer to You and the employer collectively.
If You change employers in the future and desire to Submit additional Contributions for the new employer, then You agree to secure permission from the new employer before Submitting those Contributions.

## 3. Grant of Copyright License
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Stackable and to recipients of software distributed by Stackable a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works, and to sublicense these same rights to third parties through multiple levels of sublicensees or other licensing arrangements.

If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that Your Contribution, or the work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
